## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Discord Bot (To set up a Discord bot, follow the instructions in this [README](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/discord-bot/blob/master/README.md))
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Multimedia framework for audio playback. Follow the [FFmpeg installation guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to install it.
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calebmwelsh/Discord-AudioBot.git
cd Discord-AudioBot
```

2. Prepare the configuration file:  
   Locate the `config.toml.temp` file in the project directory, open it, and replace the placeholder `DiscordBotToken` value with your bot's token. For example:

[General]
DiscordBotToken = "your-discord-bot-token"

3. After editing, rename the file to `config.toml` by removing the `.temp` extension.

4. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the bot:

python main.py

---

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:


```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  discord-bot:
    image: kdidtech/discord-audio-bot:latest
    environment:
      - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your-discord-bot-token-here
    restart: always
```

2. Replace `your-discord-bot-token-here` with your actual Discord bot token.

3. Start the bot using Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d

4. Verify the bot is running:

docker-compose ps

This will automatically pull the latest image of the bot, set up the environment variables, and ensure the bot restarts automatically if it stops or the system reboots.

## Usage

### Commands

- **`@AudioBot join`**: Joins the voice channel you are in.
- **`@AudioBot leave`**: Leaves the current voice channel.
- **`@AudioBot play <directory> <track_number>`**: Plays a specific track from a directory (e.g., `@AudioBot play Henchman 1`).
- **`@AudioBot play <file>`**: Plays a top-level audio file (e.g., `@AudioBot play Intro`).
- **`@AudioBot stop`**: Stops the currently playing audio.
- **`@AudioBot list`**: Lists all available sound files and directories.
- **`@AudioBot list expand`**: Lists all sound files and subdirectories in an expanded tree structure.

### Example

To play a specific track from a directory, mention the bot and use the `play` command:

@AudioBot play Henchman 1

To list all available sound files:

@AudioBot list

To list all sound files and subdirectories:

@AudioBot list expand

---

## Directory Structure

AudioBot looks for audio files in the `data/audio/sounds` directory. Files can be organized into subdirectories or placed directly in the top-level directory. For example:

```bash
data/audio/sounds/  
â”œâ”€â”€ Henchman/  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Henchman_1.mp3  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Henchman_2.mp3  
â”œâ”€â”€ Villain/  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Villain_1.mp3  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Villain_2.mp3  
â”œâ”€â”€ Intro.mp3  
â”œâ”€â”€ Outro.mp3
